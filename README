You'll need to install a few perl modules to run this.  

sudo cpan install Module::Name is how you do that.  
The modules are: 
	Moose
	Tie::Cycle 
	Carp
	Data::Dumper  
That should be it.  Only Moose might give you trouble.  

To run the game, just execute ./mancala.pl.  
The board prints with player1's houses labelled 1-6 and player2' 7-12.

	house1     [ 4]	house12    [ 4]
	house2     [ 4]	house11    [ 4]
	house3     [ 4]	house10    [ 4]
	house4     [ 4]	house9     [ 4]
	house5     [ 4]	house8     [ 4]
	house6     [ 4]	house7     [ 4]
	Player 1: 0
	Player 2: 0
	player1, select a move


Seed counts are in [] next to the houses and the game moves counter clockwise, or from 1 to 12.
Choose the house you want to move by entering the number of the house and pressing enter.  The 
seeds will move around the board skipping the house of origin for the seeds.  This process is 
called sewing.  If the last seed sewn is deposited in a house of your opponent then scoring is
possible.  If the total amount of seeds in that house equal two or three, those seeds are 
added to your point total and removed from the house.  Next the house numerically previous to 
that house is examined, if it's still your opponents house and the total equals two or 
three, once again those points are added to your total and remove from the house.  This 
process repeats until the previous house is no longer your opponents or the seed total does 
not equal two or three.  If you score on your move, it is still your turn and you must move
again, you must repeat this process until your move results in no score.  

If your opponet has no seeds in any of their houses on your turn, 
you must feed your opponent by selecting a house on your side that will populate at least one 
of your opponent's houses. If you are unable to feed your opponent in this situation, the game
is over and your opponent wins no matter what the score is.  If on your turn your point total
reaches 25 you, the game is over and you win.
